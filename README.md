# Flocentra

**AI-Driven Business Process Automation for Modern Companies**

Flocentra is an AI automation studio focused on designing and implementing intelligent workflow systems that eliminate manual work, reduce operational friction, and unlock scalable growth.

We help B2B companies automate repetitive operations using AI agents, workflow orchestration, and structured systems — turning chaotic processes into deterministic, production-ready automation pipelines.

## 🚀 What We Do

We design and build:

- AI-powered workflow automations  
- AI agent systems (LLM-driven decision logic)  
- End-to-end business process automation  
- Data enrichment & structured research pipelines  
- Email & lifecycle automation engines  
- Lead qualification and scoring systems  
- Internal operational tools powered by AI  

Our focus is not “AI experiments.”  
Our focus is **production-grade automation systems.**
